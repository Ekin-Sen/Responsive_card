# Responsive Card Design
* responsive card in CSS
* When the screen is minimised, the card shrinks responsively and its horizontal form changes to vertical form.
* When the cursor hovers over the card, the focus effect is applied on the image on the card.
* When the cursor hovers over the Read More button at the bottom of the card, the arrow on the side moves.
